# CS300-Project-
CS 300 Journal, Module Eight, Portfolio Turn in

Overview



A collection of artifacts from my CS 300 class is available in this repository. During the Computer Science program, we will compile a portfolio to present our best work to potential employers. This portfolio shows the abilities we have learned and acts as a catalog of our educational experience. I've included important artifacts from two projects in this submission to demonstrate my proficiency with data structures and algorithms. I've also thought back on the abilities and experiences I've gained from working on these projects.



 Artifacts Presented



1. First Project: Memory and Run-Time Analysis for Data Structures

I thoroughly examined a variety of data structures for this project, paying particular attention to how much memory and run-time efficiency each required. In order to identify the optimal data structures for various scenarios, the analysis combines theoretical and empirical evaluations. This artifact shows that I can evaluate data structures' performance and use their attributes to make well-informed decisions.



2. Project Two: Alphanumeric Course Sorting and Printing Code

I had to develop a functioning application for this project that would sort and display the Computer Science program's course list in alphabetical order. The code demonstrates my proficiency with data manipulation methods and sorting algorithms. It also showcases my ability to develop efficient, readable, and maintainable code.



Introspection



 What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?



I concentrated on two primary issues in these studies. Analyzing various data structures' run-time and memory efficiency was the initial step. Creating software that arranges and prints a course list in alphabetical order was the second task. A thorough understanding of data structures, algorithms, and their real-world applications was necessary for both assignments.



 How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important to understand?



I began addressing these issues by going over the theoretical foundations of algorithms and data structures, paying particular attention to their time and space complexities. Since data structures are the foundation of effective software development, understanding them is essential. They enable us to develop scalable and effective programs, maximize performance, and manage data efficiently.



 How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?



I faced a number of difficulties while working on these projects, like figuring out how to best sort the course list's algorithm and comprehending the trade-offs between various data formats. To get past these obstacles, I used a combination of study, peer discussions, and revisiting key concepts. In order to find the best answers, I also tried a variety of strategies.



How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?



Working on these projects has broadened my perspective on software design and development. In order to ensure that the programs not only function as intended but are also simple to comprehend and alter, I have learned to give efficiency and maintainability top priority in my code. This experience highlighted how important it is to use data structures and algorithms that meet the issue's needs.



 How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?



These initiatives have drastically changed my coding techniques and style have changed dramatically as a result of these initiatives. I now write code that is more organized, readable, and modular. I now know how to properly document my code and utilize appropriate variable names, which improves readability and future reference for the codebase. Furthermore, I've improved my ability to create programs that are simple to modify or adapt to new needs.

 Submission



I've given a link to my GitHub repository, which has the artifacts and this README file, so you may finish this submission. The repository functions as a component of my portfolio, demonstrating my proficiency with algorithms and data structures. The repository is viewable [here] (your-repository-link).



Final Thoughts



This portfolio submission demonstrates my skills in data structure analysis and developing effective, maintainable code, as well as my learning experience in CS 300. I want to improve my knowledge and application of computer science ideas by continuously reflecting on my work, so that I'm ready for any problems or opportunities that may arise in the future.
